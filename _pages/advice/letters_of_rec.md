The best recommendation letters don’t just say you’re great—they show it. Strong letters give concrete examples:  
_"Ben is a clear thinker, which he demonstrated when tackling project X. He designed Y approach, which led to A, B, and C."_

Comparisons help: how you stack up against others at your level or in similar roles. The strongest letters don’t just praise your work—they make it clear that your mentor would keep working with you if you hadn’t outgrown the role.

Ask people who know your work well _and_ have credibility. A detailed letter from a respected name is ideal, but if you have to choose, substance beats prestige.
