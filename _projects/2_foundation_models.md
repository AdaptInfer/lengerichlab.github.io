One of the most potent forms of context for statistical estimation and inference is prior knowledge. While this has historically required expert humans to apply this prior knowledge on each new problem, we now have foundation models that capture an entire domain in a large black-box model. Importantly, context-adaptive learning systems allow us to extract this prior knowledge by connecting foundation models to structured statistical models.
