Electronic health records (EHRs) are generated through the interaction of patients, clinicians, biological systems, and healthcare infrastructure. These data contain signals — and artifacts — that reflect both disease biology and the complex realities of medical care.

We collaborate directly with health systems to:

- Build **interpretable AI tools** that clinicians can trust and use,
- Discover **heterogeneous patterns** in population data for personalized medicine,
- Translate modeling insights into **practical clinical interventions**.

Our approach blends robust statistical methods with domain expertise, enabling tools that are scientifically sound and operationally feasible in real-world care settings.

This work spans partnerships with UW Health, the Emergency Care Systems Lab (ECSL), and national data providers, and is grounded in our commitment to interpretable, patient-centered modeling.
