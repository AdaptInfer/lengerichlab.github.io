Electronic health records (EHRs) reflect complex, observational data generated by a combination of patient behavior, clinical workflows, biological processes, and medical interventions. This complexity leads to statistical patterns that can deviate from biological causalityâ€”revealing both artifacts and unexpected signals.

We are building AI systems that analyze these real-world datasets to:
- Identify surprising or counterintuitive associations,
- Characterize population heterogeneity and treatment response,
- Surface opportunities to improve clinical decision-making.

This work sits at the intersection of statistical modeling and real-world evidence, with a focus on creating interpretable, patient-specific models that support precision medicine.
