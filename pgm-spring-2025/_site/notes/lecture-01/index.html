<p><strong>What is a Graphical Model?</strong></p>

<p>A graphical model is a technique for representing a probability distribution to make inferences in situations involving uncertainty, which is essential for tasks like speech recognition and computer vision. Typically, we have a dataset consisting of samples:
$D = {X_{1}^{(i)},X_{2}^{(i)},…,X_{m}^{(i)} }_{i=1}^N$. The relationships between the elements in each $X$ can be represented by a graph $G$. From this, we derive the model $M_G$.</p>

<p>Graphical models allow us to consider fundamental questions with respect to three branching categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Representation
    <ul>
      <li>How to encode our domain knowledge/assumptions/constraints?</li>
      <li>How to capture/model uncertainties in possible worlds?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Inference
    <ul>
      <li>How do I answer questions/queries according to my model and/or based on
observed data?
        <ul>
          <li>e.g: $P(X_{i} \mid D)$</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Learning
    <ul>
      <li>What model is “right” for my data?
        <ul>
          <li>e.g: $ M = \arg\max_{M \in \mathcal{H}} F(D; M) $</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The following section investigates how PGMs help us answer these questions.</p>

<h3 id="representation">Representation:</h3>

<h3 id="joint-probability-distribution-of-multiple-variables"><strong>Joint Probability Distribution of Multiple Variables</strong></h3>

<p>The <strong>joint probability distribution</strong> of a set of random variables represents the probability of all possible combinations of values that the variables can take. Given a set of variables ( X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n ), their joint probability distribution is expressed as:</p>

<p>$ P(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n) $</p>

<p>This represents the probability that all variables take specific values simultaneously. If the variables are <strong>Boolean</strong> (i.e., each ( X_i ) can either be 0 or 1), then the joint probability distribution represents the probability of each possible combination of 0s and 1s across the variables.</p>

<h4 id="example-joint-probability-for-a-set-of-boolean-variables">Example: Joint Probability for a Set of Boolean Variables</h4>

<p>Suppose we have a set of Boolean variables $ (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n) $. These variables can each take values from the set $ { 0, 1 } $. The joint probability distribution would describe the probability of each combination of these 8 variables.</p>

<p>The total number of configurations in this joint probability distribution is:</p>

<p>$ 2^{8} = 256 $</p>

<p>This means there are 256 different possible states for these 8 Boolean variables. For example, one possible configuration might be:</p>

<p>$ X_1 = 0, X_2 = 1, X_3 = 0, \dots, X_8 = 1 $</p>

<p>The probability for this configuration would be:</p>

<p>$ P(X_1 = 0, X_2 = 1, \dots, X_8 = 1) $</p>

<p>Thus, for $n$ Boolean variables, we would have $2^{n}$ possible configurations in the joint probability distribution.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="can-we-disallow-certain-state-configurations"><strong>Can We Disallow Certain State Configurations?</strong></h3>

<p>Yes, certain state configurations can be disallowed based on <strong>domain knowledge</strong>, <strong>assumptions</strong>, or <strong>constraints</strong>. This can be done either by <strong>conditioning</strong> the distribution on certain variables or by modifying the joint distribution to set certain configurations to zero probability.</p>

<h4 id="example-conditioning-and-disallowing-certain-configurations">Example: Conditioning and Disallowing Certain Configurations</h4>

<p>If we have the same 8 Boolean variables $ X_1, X_2, … , X_8 $, and we know that certain combinations are <strong>impossible</strong> based on domain constraints, we can <strong>condition</strong> the joint probability distribution to exclude these configurations.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the configuration $ X_1 = 0, X_2 = 1, X_3 = 0, \dots, X_8 = 1 $ is not possible. We can set:</p>

<p>$ P(X_1 = 0, X_2 = 1, X_3 = 0,…, X_8 = 1) = 0 $</p>

<p>Alternatively, we may choose to focus only on a <strong>subset</strong> of possible configurations. For example, if we know that $ X_5 $ and $ X_7 $ cannot both be 1 simultaneously, we can redefine the joint distribution as:</p>

<d-math block="">
P(X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{8} \mid X_{5} \neq 1 \, \text{or} \, X_{7} \neq 1)
</d-math>

<p>This limits the set of allowed configurations to those that respect this constraint.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="focus-on-subset-of-configurations"><strong>Focus on Subset of Configurations</strong></h3>

<p>It is possible to focus on a <strong>subset</strong> of configurations by <strong>restricting the model</strong>. This can be achieved by <strong>conditioning</strong> the joint probability distribution on a set of variables or by focusing only on valid state configurations.</p>

<h4 id="example-conditioning-and-subset-focus">Example: Conditioning and Subset Focus</h4>

<p>If we are only interested in configurations where $ X_1 = 1 $, we can <strong>condition</strong> the distribution on $ X_1 = 1 $. The resulting probability distribution is then:</p>

<d-math block="">
P(X_{2}, X_{3}, \dots, X_{8} \mid X_{1} = 1)
</d-math>

<p>This effectively narrows the focus of the distribution to only the cases where $ X_1 = 1 $, and ignores all other configurations of $ X_1 $.</p>

<p>In <strong>Markov Models</strong> or <strong>Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)</strong>, the model’s assumptions can be used to <strong>simplify</strong> the dependency structure and focus on specific subsets of states or variables. For example, in MDPs, the agent’s actions may only influence the next state and immediate reward, and the probability distribution over future states may depend only on the current state and action, not the entire history.</p>

<p>By restricting the joint probability distribution, you can focus on the most relevant or feasible configurations in the problem.</p>

<h3 id="inference">Inference</h3>

<p>To answer queries like $ P(X_i \mid D) $, we apply <strong>Bayes’ Rule</strong>:</p>

<p>$ P(X_i \mid D) = \frac{P(X_i, D)}{P(D)} $</p>

<p>Where $ P(X_i, D) $ is the joint probability of $ X_i $ and the observed data $ D $. This is computed by <strong>marginalizing</strong> over all unobserved variables:</p>

<p>$ P(X_i \mid D) = \frac{\sum_{X_1, \dots, X_n} P(X_1, \dots, X_n, D)}{P(D)} $</p>

<p>Here, the sum is over all possible configurations of the unobserved variables. The denominator $ P(D) $ is the <strong>marginal likelihood</strong>.</p>

<p>In simpler cases, if the variables are <strong>independent</strong>, the joint distribution factorizes. For instance, if $ X_i $ is independent of other variables, then:</p>

<p>$ P(X_i \mid D) = P(X_i) $</p>

<p>This reduces the computation, as we don’t need to sum over other variables.</p>

<p><strong>Graphical models</strong> like <strong>Bayesian Networks</strong> exploit conditional independencies between variables, allowing us to factorize the joint distribution:</p>

<p>$ P(X_1, \dots, X_n) = \prod_{i} P(X_i \mid \text{parents}(X_i)) $</p>

<p>This structure simplifies inference by reducing the number of configurations to sum over, making it more efficient.</p>

<p>Note: If all $ X_i are independent, P(X_8 \mid X_1) = P(X_8) $.</p>

<p>As a more specific case, view the sample calculation below:</p>

<h3 id="learning-finding-the-right-model">Learning: Finding the Right Model</h3>

<p>When we talk about learning in the context of probabilistic models, we usually aim to choose the model $ M $ from a set of possible models $ \mathcal{H} $ that best explains or fits the observed data $ D $.</p>

<p>The goal is to find the model $ M $ that maximizes some objective function, typically the likelihood of the data, or some score function, denoted as $ F(D; M) $. This can be written as:</p>

<p>$ M = \arg\max_{M \in \mathcal{H}} F(D; M) $</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$ M $ is the model we are selecting.</li>
  <li>$ \mathcal{H} $ is the hypothesis space, which is the set of all possible models.</li>
  <li>$ F(D; M) $ is a function that evaluates how well model $ M $ explains the data $ D $ (e.g., likelihood, Bayesian posterior, or another scoring function).</li>
  <li>$ \arg\max $ means we are finding the model $ M $ that maximizes $ F(D; M) $.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="constraining-the-hypothesis-space--mathcalh-">Constraining the Hypothesis Space $ \mathcal{H} $</h3>

<p>To make the search for the optimal model more efficient, we need to constrain the hypothesis space $ \mathcal{H} $. Without constraints, the space of possible models may be too large to search efficiently.</p>

<h4 id="suggested-methods-to-constrain--mathcalh-">Suggested methods to Constrain $ \mathcal{H} $:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Prior Knowledge</strong>: Use domain knowledge to narrow down the set of possible models. This could involve specifying certain structures, such as limiting the models to certain types of graphical models (e.g., Bayesian networks, Markov chains) or making assumptions about the data (e.g., assuming Gaussian distributions).</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Regularization</strong>: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and guide the search for simpler models. This can include:
    <ul>
      <li>L1 regularization (Lasso) or L2 regularization (Ridge) to penalize large model parameters.</li>
      <li>Bayesian priors that favor certain kinds of models over others.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Model Family</strong>: Instead of searching over all possible models, restrict the search to a <strong>family of models</strong> (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, etc.), which reduces the hypothesis space $ \mathcal{H} $.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Simplifying Assumptions</strong>: For instance, in graphical models, you might assume <strong>conditional independence</strong> between certain variables to reduce the complexity of the search space.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>If the $X$’s are conditional independence (as encoded by a PGM), then the joint can be factorized into a product of simpler terms:</li>
</ul>

<d-math block="">
\begin{aligned}
  P(X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, X_{4}, X_{5}, X_{6}, X_{7}, X_{8}) &amp;= P(X_{1}) \, P(X_{2}) \, P(X_{3} \mid X_{1}) \, P(X_{4} \mid X_{2}) \, P(X_{5} \mid X_{2}) \, P(X_{6} \mid X_{3}, X_{4}) \, P(X_{7} \mid X_{6}) \, P(X_{8} \mid X_{6}, X_{5}) \\
\end{aligned}
</d-math>

<p>The benefits of this representation are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="why-pgms">Why PGMs?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Incorporation of domain knowledge and causal (logical) structures</strong><br />
PGMs allow you to directly encode <strong>domain knowledge</strong> and <strong>causal relationships</strong> into the model. This makes it easier to represent real-world dependencies, such as how diseases cause symptoms or how different factors influence one another.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Learning domain knowledge and causal structures from data</strong><br />
PGMs can <strong>learn</strong> new relationships from data, automatically detecting dependencies, correlations, and causal links, which makes them adaptable to new, unseen data or changing environments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Modular combination of heterogeneous parts – data fusion</strong><br />
PGMs can <strong>combine data from multiple sources</strong> (e.g., sensors, behaviors, environmental factors) into a unified model, allowing for <strong>data fusion</strong> that improves accuracy and provides a comprehensive view of the system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bayesian Learning – can easily incorporate uncertainty, and can be specific to a particular part of the model</strong><br />
PGMs use <strong>Bayesian learning</strong> to incorporate uncertainty into the model, representing probabilities rather than hard predictions. This allows for <strong>localized uncertainty</strong> in specific variables or components without affecting the whole model.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-a-pgm-differ-from-a-gm">How does a PGM differ from a GM?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>PGM = Multivariate Statistics + Structure</li>
  <li>
    <p>GM = Multivariate Objective Function + Structure</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Formally:</strong> A PGM is a family of distributions on a set of random variables that are compatible with all the probabilistic independence propositions encoded by a graph that connects these variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>The two types of GMs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Directed</strong> edges give causality relationships (Bayesian Network or Directed Graphical Model)</li>
  <li><strong>Undirected</strong> edges simply give correlations between variables (Markov Random Field or Undirected Graphical model):</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, the Bayes net uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
Each node in a Bayes net has a Markov blanket, composed of its parents, its children, and its children’s parents. Every node is conditionally independent of the nodes outside its Markov Blanket. Therefore, the local conditional probabilities as well as the graph structure completely determine the joint probability distribution. This model represents causality relationships can be used to generate new data.They are acyclic in order to ensure no feedback loops, maintaining a clear causality structure.</p>

<p>By contrast, the Markov random field uses an undirected graph. Every node is conditionally independent of the other graph nodes, except for its immediate neighbors. To determine the joint probability distribution, we need to know local contingency functions as well as structural cliques. This model represents correlation between variables, but cannot explicitly generate new data. Note that these structures <em>can</em> include cycles, unlike Bayesian Networks.</p>

<h3 id="towards-structural-specification-of-probability-distributions">Towards structural specification of probability distributions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Separation properties in the graph imply independence properties about the associated variables.</li>
  <li>For the graph to be useful, any conditional independence properties we can derive from the graph should hold for the probability distribution that the graph represents.</li>
  <li>The Equivalence Theorem:
    <ul>
      <li>For a graph $ G $,</li>
      <li>Let $ D_1 $ denote the family of all distributions that satisfy $ I(G) $,</li>
      <li>Let $ D_2 $ denote the family of all distributions that factor according to $ G $,</li>
      <li>Then $ D_1 \equiv D_2 $.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
